# Implementation Plan - Stock Market Website

The goal is to create a visually stunning stock market dashboard displaying KOSPI, KOSDAQ, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 indices.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> **Data Source**: Due to CORS restrictions and the lack of a dedicated backend in this environment, the application will use **simulated real-time data** for demonstration purposes. The architecture will be designed to easily swap this with a real API (like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage) later.

## Proposed Changes

### Frontend Core
#### [NEW] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/needl/Desktop/예제 9/index.html)
-   Semantic HTML5 structure.
-   Header with site title and current time.
-   Main grid layout for 4 charts.
-   Import Chart.js via CDN.

#### [NEW] [style.css](file:///c:/Users/needl/Desktop/예제 9/style.css)
-   **Theme**: Cyberpunk/Modern Financial Dark Mode.
-   **Color Palette**: Deep blacks/grays, Neon Green (Up), Neon Red (Down).
-   **Effects**: Glassmorphism cards, smooth transitions, glowing text.
-   **Layout**: CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsiveness.

#### [NEW] [script.js](file:///c:/Users/needl/Desktop/예제 9/script.js)
-   **Chart Logic**: Initialize 4 instances of Chart.js.
-   **Data Simulation**: Generate realistic intraday-style data points.
-   **Updates**: simulated live ticker updates every few seconds.
-   **Indices**:
    -   KOSPI
    -   KOSDAQ
    -   NASDAQ
    -   S&P 500

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
-   None (Visual inspection required).

### Manual Verification
1.  Open `index.html` in browser.
2.  Verify all 4 charts render.
3.  Verify animations work smoothy.
4.  Check responsiveness on different window sizes.
